import UIKit

print("Hello Tanmay!!")
// print function is used to print statements

// Variables : Entities that change(in future) are called variables and are declared by "var" keyword
var variable = 10
variable = variable + 1 ; // a has changed from 10 to 11 , so used "var" keyword
print(variable)

// Constants : Entities that remain constant(ie do not change) eg. Maximum values will never change! and declared by "let" keyword!
let constant = 6 ;
// (constant = constant + 1) --> This statement will give an error
print(constant)

// Unlike other programming languages , it does not compulsorily end statements with semicolons (we can use)

var semicolon_knowledge = 32 ; // Valid statement

// Buttt if we are writing more than one statements on a single line like...
var more_statements = 29 ; print(more_statements) ; print(semicolon_knowledge) // semicolon between those is mandetory
